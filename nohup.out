Initialising GoAT analysis...

==========================================================
Setting up Data Checks:
==========================================================
Data Check (CB Stability) turned on
Using cutoff ratio of 0.5 (default)

==========================================================
Setting up sorting criteria:
==========================================================
Sort: Crystal Ball Energy Sum 80 or more 

Sort: Total # of Tracks before reconstruction   3 or less 
Sort: # of Tracks before reconstruction in CB   0 or more 
Sort: # of Tracks before reconstruction in TAPS 0 or more 

Sort: neutralPions (1=,0,180)

==========================================================
Setting up analysis classes:
==========================================================

Particle Reconstruction turned ON
Pi0 IM width cut set to 100 MeV
Eta IM width cut set to 44 MeV
Eta-Prime IM width cut set to 60 MeV


Initialisation complete.
